This Project is unstable! No actually it doesn't even work at all!

This is a school project written in c# which aims to provide an engine to host a Multi User Dungeon. This engine doesn't support the telnet protocol which probably makes it useless to you (besides the fact that it is written in c# by unexperienced students). Feel free to read the code, laugh about it and give us some hints for improvement.
